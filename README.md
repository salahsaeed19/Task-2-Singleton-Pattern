# Shape Area Calculator

### This is a Java program that calculates the area of different shapes using the Singleton Pattern and interface-based design.

* The project is a Java program that calculates the area of different shapes, such as Circle, Square, Rectangle, and Triangle.

* It uses the Singleton Pattern, which ensures that there is only one instance of the ShapeFactory class throughout the program, and that instances of the various shapes are created and managed efficiently. 

* The program demonstrates the use of interfaces and class inheritance to model different shapes and calculate their areas, and also showcases some common Java features, such as switch statements and variable-length argument lists.

* Overall, the project provides a simple yet practical example of how Java can be used to model and calculate the properties of different shapes, and how design patterns can be used to ensure the efficient use of resources in a program.
